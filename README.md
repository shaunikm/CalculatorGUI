## Calculator GUI
-----------------
A simple project I made in a few days. It functions like a basic calculator, but it doesn't have "Scientific Mode" or
any complicated buttons. I will try to add modes like that if requested or just for fun. I will also try to make a
version where you can run the GUI easily (like a command line command).
-------------------------------------
If you look at the code, there will be some comments saying:
```python
# In Development
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"""
Code in development
"""
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
This symbolizes that the code can be **VERY** glitchy. If there are glitches when using that portion of the code, please
report the glitches as I might not know that that glitch exists.

#### Additional & Important Information

This calculator is still in development, so there may be many bugs or some buttons that don't work properly. In this
case, please make an issue and I will try to fix the big/glitch as fast as I can. Along the way, I might make some
changes to the calculator's looks, but for now it will be blocky and somewhat messy.
